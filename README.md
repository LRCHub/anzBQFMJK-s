Hey
You're running from what
You can't escape
Come my way
I'll put you under
Some kind of state
Astray
So watch me hypnotize
You with my eyes
Make you fantasize
Bout me tonight
I'm hypnotizing
Hypnotizing
Side to side got you hypnotized
'Cause everytime my clock
Tick tock like this
Every little spell I cast
Don't miss
Always on top top top
I'm hypnotizing
Gotcha doing what I want want want
all night
Wake up to the click of sound
Follow with your eyes
Watch me watch me hypnotize
You'll be where I want you every night
You'll be back to feed your appetite
Swirling hypno disc illusion
My command becomes your reason
In your consciousness
Now your mind is of no consequence
I betcha never seen a girl so confident
Cut the compliments that's just
Common sense
So watch me hypnotize
You with my eyes
Make you fantasize
Bout me tonight
I'm hypnotizing
Hypnotizing
Side to side got you hypnotized
'Cause everytime my clock
Tick tock like this
Every little spell I cast
Don't miss
Always on top top top
I'm hypnotizing
Gotcha doing what I want want want
all night
Wake up to the click of sound
Follow with your eyes
Watch me watch me hypnotize
When you fall asleep
What do you see?
I know it's me
Dreams
When you're fast asleep
It's all we have
You wake and stare
Like you're lost in the room
Too late too bad
Boy you know what to do
Now you playing my game
I'll keep you doing my favors
Side to side got you hypnotized
'Cause everytime my clock
Tick tock like this
(Every time we kiss)
Every little spell I cast
Don't miss
Always on top top top
I'm hypnotizing (I'm hypnotizing)
Gotcha doing what I want want want
all night (ah yeah)
Wake up to the click of sound (all right)
Follow with your eyes
Watch me watch me hypnotize
